# Shiny_app
The code for my shiny app
I'm having real trouble to upload the app to the shinyio site, in my first try I designed an app using rCharts but it failed, in the second try I did the same app using ggplo2 instead, but I can't manage to deploy the data to the shinyio site.
In the folder app_rChart you can find the code for the first try.
In the folder soc_gap_explorer you can find the code for the second one.
